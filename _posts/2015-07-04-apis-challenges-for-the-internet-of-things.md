Now days we’re living in a big cloud revolution, also called by web 3.0, a lot of things can be processed in the Cloud, every day we’re upgrading our capacity of communication with big network bandwidth capacity. We’re also arriving in the new age of Semantic Web, where all the data and context can be analyzed and be more well processed. A couple of years ago it was hard to imagine something like Siri (Apple), Google Now and Amazon Echo. Have you watched the movie [“Her”](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/), if yes, does that remind you something?

The humanity is working on big improvements to integrate and make an easy communication with any dispositive through internet. Imagine your fridge telling you that you’re running out of Milk, your bed telling you that you lost 1 pond since the last night of sleep, your trash sending you a sms to tell you that it’s full, or even your coffee machine posting on twitter. Things like that are going to be accessible in a couple of years.

Scientists and technology communities have been working in a lot of technologies for helping us to detect and interact with internet, such as Arduino, Raspberry pi, Sensors and Spark core. That’s helping us to create a new concept of Smart Home (Domotics), where everything can have intelligence and interconnectivity with internet. For example, control your your lights just saying: “Alexa, turn off all the lights”. That’s one good examples that Amazon is building now.

Several technologies are being developed now, but we need to pay attention for the power of the interfaces (API) that we are using for communication between those applications and dispositive. We have a lot of challenges that involves internet connection, contingence for operation, APIs security, scalability, deliverable documentation and auto discovering of interfaces. Must of our challenges now are based in connectivity and realtime process.

One of the big problems that is being researched now is how to deal with security of those APIs, as we know, the internet is a vulnerable place for cyber attacks, where hackers can find ways to get inside and control your system. That introduces a lot of risks such as baby monitors control, car control, light traffic, house temperature and also digital door lockers.

A couple of months ago, Google launched a new technology for the internet of Things: Brillo. It’s based on Android and can run on minimal system requirements, for the case of domestic and not robust processor for dispositive like lightbulbs for example. Brillo also offer a protocol for synchronizing data between devices, providing a grate way for connection.

We’re now able to enjoy a lot of functionalities and sensors that the internet of things can provide for us, with such facilities we also have some responsibilities to take care about security, scalability and fault tolerance of all those dispositive. There’re may opportunities to create new projects to help us in our daily life and APIs are providing away to drive those technologies for the humanity.
