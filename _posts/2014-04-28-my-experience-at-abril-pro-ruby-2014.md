A couple of months ago, after I spent 6 months living in Austin-TX, I decided to try to keep traveling in Brazil. I wanted to use my trips to improve my professional knowledge. Abril pro Ruby was one of the first conferences that happened in a beach environment. It wasn’t the first time that I attend an Event, but It’s the first time that I started to try to feel the culture of the place that I was visiting. It was one of the most amazing events that I attended, and the reason for this was the big opportunity to meet a lot of Ruby developers from Brazil and also from United States and a great moment to personally meet developers that I just knew via internet.

A beach, a good environment, beer, party, knowledge. Abril pro Ruby was kind of different from the another events because they started with a workshop day, and at the end of this day all the people of all the workshops had a great opportunity to do some networking in a DrinkUp sponsored by Github. What a nice idea, a lot of beers, a lot of developers and a cool place. I think it was a great opportunity to met some new developers and see how the companies from the United States hire people from Brazil.

Finally, on April 26th which was characterized by awesome keynotes presented by various international names of some big companies like Shopify, SendGrid, Locaweb, Glogo.com, Microsoft, Plataformatec and Harvest. I had the opportunity to  get to know some of the speakers from the previous day. On this day my city was properly represented by a lot of developers, and it showed me that the Ruby community in Maceió-AL is getting big.

Some of the presentations were more relevant for me. João Moura explained more about MVP (Minimum Viable Product) applied to some market technologies. I learned a new paradigm about Database Domain oriented using multiple paradigms, and Lucas Dolmen did it very well. I finally saw how Shopify's software architecture works in their environment. Arthur Neves showed us how they’re using rails as the framework and how they’re replicating and “sharding” the databases. One of the most interesting a approaches was made by Scott Motte of Sendgrid, He talked about an alternative authentication system using only email. All keynotes were great, but these were the ones that gave me more knowledge.

April Pro Ruby certainly has surprised me in organization, and I know how they feel about organizing an event. It’s a hard job and they helped introduce a lot of developers to new, exciting technologies.Well, I hope to attend again next year.
