It's one of a lot of attempts to improve my professional and personal skills, I'm doing this space to share some good feelings and experiences about some projects that I'm working. Usually with Web development and APIs in general.

Usually I'm going to post in English. Just to improve my skills. Fell free to help me with some mistakes on this language.

I'm going to try initially as a doctrine, post 1 time every 2 weeks. I hope. o/ #herewego
